# Module 02: Value Methods (Q-Learning, DQN)

## Overview
Value-based reinforcement learning methods learn to estimate the expected future rewards of states or state-action pairs, enabling optimal decision making through value function optimization. This module covers the theoretical foundations, practical implementations, and modern deep learning extensions of value methods.

## Learning Objectives
- Define value functions and understand the Bellman equations
- Implement tabular Q-learning for discrete environments
- Master Deep Q-Network (DQN) with stabilization techniques
- Recognize advanced DQN variants and their improvements
- Apply value methods to real-world control problems

## Key Concepts

### Value Functions: The Foundation of Value-Based RL
Value functions estimate **how good** it is to be in a particular state (or take a particular action in a state):

#### State Value Function V^œÄ(s)
**Definition**: Expected cumulative reward from state `s` following policy `œÄ`
```
V^œÄ(s) = E_œÄ[G_t | S_t = s] = E_œÄ[‚àë_{k=0}^‚àû Œ≥^k R_{t+k+1} | S_t = s]
```
**Intuition**: "How valuable is this state under my current strategy?"

#### Action-Value Function Q^œÄ(s,a)
**Definition**: Expected cumulative reward from taking action `a` in state `s`, then following policy `œÄ`
```
Q^œÄ(s,a) = E_œÄ[G_t | S_t = s, A_t = a]
```
**Intuition**: "How valuable is this action in this state?"

### Bellman Equations: The Recursive Structure
The Bellman equations express the recursive relationship between values:

#### Bellman Expectation Equations
- **State values**: `V^œÄ(s) = E_œÄ[R_{t+1} + Œ≥ V^œÄ(S_{t+1}) | S_t = s]`
- **Action values**: `Q^œÄ(s,a) = E[R_{t+1} + Œ≥ E_œÄ[V^œÄ(S_{t+1})] | S_t = s, A_t = a]`

#### Bellman Optimality Equations
- **Optimal state values**: `V*(s) = max_a Q*(s,a) = max_a E[R_{t+1} + Œ≥ V*(S_{t+1}) | S_t = s, A_t = a]`
- **Optimal action values**: `Q*(s,a) = E[R_{t+1} + Œ≥ max_{a'} Q*(S_{t+1}, a') | S_t = s, A_t = a]`

**Why Bellman Equations Matter:**
- **Decompose complex problems** into simpler subproblems
- **Enable iterative solutions** through dynamic programming
- **Guarantee convergence** to optimal values under certain conditions
- **Foundation for temporal difference learning**

## üéØ Q-Learning: Learning Optimal Action Values

### Tabular Q-Learning Algorithm
Q-Learning directly learns the optimal action-value function Q*(s,a) without needing a model of the environment:

```python
# Initialize Q-table with zeros
Q = np.zeros((num_states, num_actions))

# For each episode:
for episode in range(num_episodes):
    state = env.reset()
    while not done:
        # Choose action using Œµ-greedy policy
        action = epsilon_greedy(Q[state], epsilon)

        # Take action, observe reward and next state
        next_state, reward, done = env.step(action)

        # Q-Learning update
        td_target = reward + gamma * np.max(Q[next_state])
        td_error = td_target - Q[state, action]
        Q[state, action] += alpha * td_error

        state = next_state
```

**Key Properties:**
- **Off-policy**: Learns optimal Q* regardless of behavior policy
- **Model-free**: No need to know transition probabilities
- **Guaranteed convergence**: Under tabular conditions with proper exploration

## üß† Deep Q-Networks (DQN): Scaling to Complex Domains

When state spaces become too large for tables, we use neural networks to approximate Q-functions.

### Core DQN Stabilization Techniques

#### 1. Experience Replay
Store and randomly sample experiences to break temporal correlations:

```python
# Sample random batch for learning
batch = replay_buffer.sample(batch_size)
# Breaks correlation between consecutive samples!
```

**Why it helps**:
- **Breaks temporal correlations** in sequential data
- **More data-efficient** through experience reuse
- **Stabilizes learning** by providing diverse training samples

#### 2. Target Network
Use a separate, slowly-updated network for targets:
```python
# Main network: Q(s,a; Œ∏)
# Target network: Q(s,a; Œ∏‚Åª) where Œ∏‚Åª is updated less frequently

td_target = r + gamma * max_a Q(s_next, a; Œ∏‚Åª)  # Use target network
loss = (Q(s, a; Œ∏) - td_target)¬≤
```

**Why it helps**:
- Targets change slowly, providing stability
- Reduces correlation between predictions and targets

### DQN Architecture
```
State (4D vector) ‚Üí Linear(128) ‚Üí ReLU ‚Üí Linear(128) ‚Üí ReLU ‚Üí Linear(2) ‚Üí Q-values
```

For Atari: `Image ‚Üí Conv layers ‚Üí Flatten ‚Üí Linear layers ‚Üí Q-values`

### DQN Training Loop
```python
# Initialize networks
q_network = QNetwork()
target_network = QNetwork()
replay_buffer = ReplayBuffer()

for episode in episodes:
    state = env.reset()
    while not done:
        # Epsilon-greedy action selection
        action = select_action(state, epsilon)
        next_state, reward, done = env.step(action)

        # Store experience
        replay_buffer.add(state, action, reward, next_state, done)

        # Train on batch
        if len(replay_buffer) > min_size:
            batch = replay_buffer.sample(batch_size)
            loss = compute_td_loss(batch, q_network, target_network)
            optimize(loss)

        # Update target network periodically
        if step % target_update_freq == 0:
            target_network.load_state_dict(q_network.state_dict())
```

## üöÄ DQN Improvements (Preview)

### Double DQN
**Problem**: DQN overestimates Q-values due to max operator bias.
**Solution**: Use main network to select action, target network to evaluate.

### Dueling DQN
**Problem**: Not all states need precise action-value estimates.
**Solution**: Separate value and advantage streams: Q(s,a) = V(s) + A(s,a) - mean(A(s,:))

### Prioritized Experience Replay
**Problem**: All experiences aren't equally important.
**Solution**: Sample experiences proportional to their TD error.

### Rainbow DQN
Combines multiple improvements: Double DQN + Dueling + Prioritized Replay + Distributional RL + Noisy Networks + Multi-step learning.

## üéØ When to Use Value-Based Methods

### ‚úÖ Good for:
- **Discrete action spaces** (or easily discretizable)
- **Sample efficiency** important (reuse data via replay)
- **Off-policy learning** needed
- **Interpretable action selection** (argmax Q-values)

### ‚ùå Challenging for:
- **Continuous action spaces** (exponential complexity)
- **Very large action spaces** (curse of dimensionality)
- **Stochastic optimal policies** (value methods learn deterministic policies)

## üî¨ Understanding Your Q-Network

### Debugging Questions
1. **Are Q-values reasonable?** (Not too high/low, ordered sensibly)
2. **Is the network learning?** (Loss decreasing, Q-values changing)
3. **Exploration vs exploitation balance?** (Not too much/little exploration)
4. **Target network updates?** (Not too frequent/infrequent)

### Common Failure Modes
- **Overestimation bias**: Q-values grow unrealistically high
- **Instability**: Q-values oscillate wildly
- **Poor exploration**: Agent gets stuck in suboptimal behavior
- **Catastrophic forgetting**: Performance drops suddenly

## üìã Practical Exercises

### Exercise 1: Tabular Q-Learning
```bash
python examples/q_learning_cartpole.py --episodes 5000 --alpha 0.1 --gamma 0.99
```
**Experiment**: Try different discretization schemes. How does it affect learning?

### Exercise 2: DQN CartPole
```bash
python examples/dqn_cartpole.py --episodes 400 --learning-rate 1e-3 --batch-size 64
```
**Questions**:
- What happens without experience replay?
- How does target network update frequency affect learning?

### Exercise 3: Hyperparameter Sensitivity
Try different values for:
- Learning rate: [1e-4, 1e-3, 1e-2]
- Epsilon decay: [200, 500, 1000]
- Batch size: [32, 64, 128]

Which combinations work best?

### Exercise 4: Visualizing Q-Values
Modify the DQN code to log and plot Q-values over time. Do they stabilize? Grow? Oscillate?

## üß© Design Patterns

### The Q-Learning Pattern
1. **Initialize** Q-function (table or network)
2. **Interact** with environment using Œµ-greedy
3. **Store** experiences (if using replay)
4. **Update** Q-function using Bellman equation
5. **Repeat** until convergence

### The Experience Replay Pattern
1. **Circular buffer** for storage efficiency
2. **Random sampling** to break correlations
3. **Prioritized sampling** for important experiences
4. **Batch updates** for computational efficiency

## üîç Deep Dive Questions
1. **Theoretical**: Why does Q-learning converge in the tabular case but not always with function approximation?
2. **Practical**: How would you adapt DQN for a problem with 1000 discrete actions?
3. **Design**: What other ways could you stabilize Q-learning besides target networks?
4. **Applied**: How might you use Q-learning for resource allocation in cloud computing?
